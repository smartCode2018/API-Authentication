# Node.js API-Authentication

Hello Buddies,
its me again smartcode.kc.

This time around i created an easy to use quick start-up boiler plate for any NODE.JS application you will be building next.

In this project i took time to integrate a very secured and flexible Authentication system, that you can integrate with any front-end framework of your choice.

Be it React.js, Vue.js, Or Angular.

This Auth system is designed with

1) Passport,
2) JWT Token, And
3) Joi library for data validation

The backend is designed with Node.js, Express.js and MySQL database.

It is easy to use and follow. each security package is configured in its own folder.

To use this boiler-plate, just clone or download it and run

npm install

if you have any issues, feel free to contact me.
